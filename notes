Running the code use go run ./api -config_path="path/to/config"

// ------  Inventory API 
json document will look sometihng like this 
 {
     id: price_cents :  int64
     name: string
     flooring_type: string
     thickness: float64
     color: string
     area: float64 // may or may not be float64
 }

 TO DO:
 1. Make sure the put method works correctly
 2. Write Insert, Update, Remove Queries and test them directly in MySQL 
 3. Create a struct for the Inventory document
 4. Write basic Route and Route handler that prints received json back (
     maybe add a field to the printed json that says what REQUEST_TYPE it was ie: put, patch, delete, get)
5. Write struct methods to handle putting, patching, deleting anf retreving inventory information
        (this end point will probaably need ot grab 1 or all)
6. Update handler to call the appropriate method and reutrn the appropriate response for each HTTP Request type 



later on add:
- unit tests for th api
